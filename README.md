# listen-up

A webpage that displays a list of songs. The songs in the list can be favorited, reordered, edited, or deleted.

 * _Allow category creation (by genres, artists, etc.)_
 * _Give better colors/design to webpage_
 * _Drag and drop list items to change position_
 * _Persist webpage across multiple sessions_
